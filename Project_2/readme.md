###**Project Requirements**

This project was to demonstrate that I understood making arrays. 

The project had to include reading from a file using deliminators, placing the information in an array,
and using that information to caluclate data and place it in the array. 

Then the data had to be displayed in different ways, with all data showing and selected data. 

Finally, selected data had to be saved to a new file.
